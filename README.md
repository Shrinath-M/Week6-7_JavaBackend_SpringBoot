# Week 06 & 07 - Java Backend - Spring Boot 

Welcome to **Weeks 6 & 7** of our Java Backend journey!  
In these weeks, we dive deep into building Java web applications using **Servlets** and the powerful **Spring Boot Framework**. We will explore web servers, REST APIs, multi-layer architectures, and develop real-world applications such as Employee Payroll and Address Book apps.

## Overview

During these weeks, you will:

- Understand the basics of Java Web Servers using **Tomcat and Servlets**.  
- Learn the fundamentals of **Spring Core Framework** — IoC, Dependency Injection, and annotations.  
- Develop RESTful APIs with Spring, handling HTTP methods and request mappings.  
- Explore multi-layered architecture concepts and integrate with an in-memory **H2 Database**.  
- Build full-fledged backend applications like Employee Payroll and Address Book with service layers and REST endpoints.
